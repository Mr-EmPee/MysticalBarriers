# Mystical Barriers

This plugin provides a unique and customizable way to define barriers that are visible and interactive only to a subset of players. These barriers can be used to limit access to specific areas, creating exclusive zones or protected regions within your game environment.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of MysticalBarriers is to offer server administrators a tool to control player movement and interaction in a dynamic and flexible manner. By implementing these barriers, you can:

- Restrict access to certain areas based on player roles or permissions.
- Create private or exclusive zones for specific player groups.
- Enhance game mechanics by introducing new strategic elements involving barrier usage.
- Ensure controlled entry points in event scenarios or special locations.

## Features
- **Single Block Barriers**: Create simple, single-block barriers that are easy to set up and manage.
- **Complex Structures**: Build your own custom barriers that can appear and disappear

- **Visibility Control**: Barriers are only visible and interactive to the subset of players you define, ensuring privacy and controlled access.
- **Projectile Blocking**: Barriers are not just for show; they effectively block projectiles, adding an extra layer of strategy to your gameplay.

- **User-Friendly Commands**: Simple commands to create, manage, and configure barriers without extensive setup.
- **Permission-Based Access**: Define which players or groups can see and interact with the barriers using a flexible permission system.
