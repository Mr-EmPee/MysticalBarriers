# MysticalBarriers
A minecraft plugin that allows you to create magic walls visible only to a group players

## How to use it
1. Get a wand by using `/mb wand` and select the corners of your wall
2. Execute `/mb create <barrier_name>`
3. Barrier created! Now every player that HAS the permission `mysticalbarriers.bypass.<barrier_name>` will NOT see the wall

## How to customize a barrier
1. Execute `/mb modify`

## TODO
- [ ] Block living entities from passing through a wall
- [ ] Block mounts from passing through a wall
- [ ] Create particle walls, atm you can only have block walls
